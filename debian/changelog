ros-hydro-hector-quadrotor-model (0.3.4-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * make models more robust against irregular input values
    Especially on collisions with walls and obstacles Gazebo can output very high
    velocity values for some reason, which caused the propulsion and aerodynamic
    models to output infinite values or NaN as resulting forces and torques, with
    the consequence that Gazebo effectively stopped simulation and showed the quadrotor
    at the origin of the world frame.
    With this patch the simulation is much more stable in case of collisions or
    hard landings.
  * disabled quadratic term (CT2s) in propeller speed to performance factor J
    Because of this term the model output a non-zero thrust even if the propeller speed was zero.
    The quadratic term is due to drag and therefore covered in the aerodynamics model.
