Description: hector_quadrotor_gazebo_plugins provides gazebo plugins for using quadrotors in gazebo. The hector_gazebo_ros_baro sensor plugin simulates an altimeter based on barometric pressure. hector_quadrotor_simple_controller is a simple controller allowing to command the quadrotor's velocity using a geometry_msgs/Twist message for teleoperation just by means of applying forces and torques to the model.
