%description
hector_quadrotor_gazebo_plugins provides gazebo plugins for using quadrotors in
gazebo. The hector_gazebo_ros_baro sensor plugin simulates an altimeter based on
barometric pressure. hector_quadrotor_simple_controller is a simple controller
allowing to command the quadrotor's velocity using a geometry_msgs/Twist message
for teleoperation just by means of applying forces and torques to the model.
